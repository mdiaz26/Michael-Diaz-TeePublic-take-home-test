Options:
- Use ActiveRecord to put our json data into a DB with models representing inventory, options (join table), and attributes. Our queries would parse through our options table to find instances that met our qualifications...but this would produce a bunch of options, not the output we're looking for. We could just iterate through the items and add to a list every time there's a new quality. Then just print the resulting object with the desired formatting.
- If we didn't use ActiveRecord, we'd have to create instances from our JSON and the a class method that could collect them all for filtering. There would be an Inventory class with id, name, and options attributes. There would be an Options class with overloading constructors to account for a variety of possible attributes. We would then just build a method or methods that could be invoked to filter through our instances and build a new object that shows all the existing attributes. It would be O(n) time but it would would abstract much less.
